This extension makes it super-easy to use the [MonkMakes Plant Monitor](https://monkmakes.com/pmon)

## Use as Extension

This repository can be added as an **extension** in MakeCode.

* open [https://makecode.microbit.org/](https://makecode.microbit.org/)
* click on **New Project**
* click on **Extensions** under the gearwheel menu
* search for **Plant Monitor** select **MonkMakes Planr Monitor** and import

## Connecting Your micro:bit

Your micro:bit uses pins 1 and 2 to communicate with the Plant Monitor's serial interface. Use alligator clip leads to connect your micro:bit and Plant Monitor as shown below.

You can also optionally connect P0 of the micro:bit to the left-most of the Plant Monotr (icon looks like a plot). This allows you to use the Plant Monitors and alog output measurement of the moisture level.


## Example Project
This example shows the wetness using the bar graph block. Pressing button A will show the temperature in dgrees C and pressing button B, the relative humidity as a percentage.

## Documentation

A datasheet and full instructions for the Plant Monitor, both for the micro:bit and many other platforms such as the Raspbery Pi, Arduino etc can be found on the [product page for the MonkMakes Plant Monitor](https://monkmakes.com/pmon)
